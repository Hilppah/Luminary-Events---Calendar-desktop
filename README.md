# Luminary-Events---Calendar-desktop
A school project made for Luminary Events. This was a third year OAMK school project of a calendar that uses .NET as it's platform and C# as it's main language. It was made for Luminary Events so they have a calender that list their events and the start and end date of them and the customers name. We used the same database as another group that is not included in this.
